# Overview

StudentConnect is the solution for hassle-free team formation for CS2103T students to browse profiles and connect with others for group projects.

# Summary of Contributions

## Code contributed
* Link to [RepoSense report](https://nus-cs2103-ay2324s1.github.io/tp-dashboard/?search=maj0-0&breakdown=false&sort=groupTitle%20dsc&sortWithin=title&since=2023-09-22&timeframe=commit&mergegroup=&groupSelect=groupByRepos)

## Enhancements implemented
* **New Feature**: Tasks Command
    * What it does: Lists out the set of tasks for each group.
    * Highlights: Since StudentConnect is catered towards CS2103T and CS2101, the tasks are pre-set and are automatically assigned to each group.
    * Challenges: Our team had initially planned to have a separate UI list for tasks, but due to time constraints, the tasks now show up in the feedback panel instead.
* **Enhancement**: Added Tutorial, Gender and Nationality fields
    * Included the tutorial, nationality and gender fields to the person model, and modified the UI to reflect these changes.
* **Enhancement**: List Command
  * Updated the list students feature's success message to match StudentConnect context
